User clicks on the row, status indicator, alters status. 
The status indicator modal must have the entire user entry/only uid.
Don't alter state locally. When you click a radio button, it should run a cloud function that modifies the
user's status db side (cloud function).
If the cloud function returns successfully, modify local state.
